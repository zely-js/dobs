This template provides a simple way to learn how to use **dobs**.

## Start Development Server

To start the development server, run the following command:

```bash
npm dev
```

The Dobs Development Server automatically updates the server, so you don’t need to restart it to apply changes.

## Build Server

To build your TypeScript and JavaScript files into a **ready-to-run server**, run the following command:

```bash
npm build
```
